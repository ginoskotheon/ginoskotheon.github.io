    <p>I've decided that I need to learn Java. One of the greatest resources for learning how to code in almost any language is tutorials by Bucky Roberts at his New Boston YouTube channel. Check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston" target="_blank">The New Boston</a>. This is a great resource for anyone who is new to coding or if they are just new to a particular language. I got my start with development in Python, as many new coders do, and learning Java via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston" target="_blank">The New Boston</a> is actually not that tough since it's just learning new syntax for stuff I already know how to do. But Mr. Roberts does a fantastic job at explanation even if you're a total noob.</p>
