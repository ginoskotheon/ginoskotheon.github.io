    <h4>Making a Simple Gui with Java</h4>
    <p>I've spent the last few weeks slowly learning Java. I really have a ton to learn. The more I study it, the deeper it seems to go. I'm still learning fromÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">Bucky Roberts</a>,</p>
    <p> but this time I went through how to use Javafx to make a gui. Here is my result:</p>

    <p>Nothing spectacular but I did add some functionality--the ability to save the name typed in the name field to a txt document (acting as a database). Needless to say, I still have a long way to go.</p>
