    <h4>Think Like a Programmer</h4>

    <p>I'm still working my way through the Java basics. I'd probably be further along but I keep getting distracted. The thing that distracts me is that I like to code in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, I've come to the conclusion that I need to learn better how to thing like a programmer. So, I've plunged myself into another website called <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hacker Rank</a>.</p>
    <p> Among other things on this site is the ability to participate in various coding challenges. They are fun and challenging. Since I am more familiar with Python, I have been attempting these challenges in that language. Perhaps in the future I'll try the same challenges in Java.</p>

    <p>I've also been thinking about getting more into JavaScript. JavaScript seems to be used everywhere nowadays. There are plenty of online tutorials about that. One thing is for sure, the more I code, the more I want to code. It's addicting.</p>
