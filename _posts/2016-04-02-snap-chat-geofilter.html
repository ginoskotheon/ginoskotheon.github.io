    <h4>Putting Beeville on the map.</h4>

    <p>I was in San Antonio looking for an apartment for my family. I noticed that San Antonio had tons of geofilters on Snapchat. For the uninitiated, Snapchat geofilters are images that can be put on top of a picture to tell viewers where one is located.</p>

    <p>Beeville didn't have a geofilter. I thought that this was a travesty. So I designed one. Actually, I designed 3 but the third one was accepted by Snapchat. I literally put Beeville on the Snapchat map.</p>
