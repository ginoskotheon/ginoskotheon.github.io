    <h4>The new adventure...</h4>

        <div class="box">We have called San Antonio our home for more than a week now. It's been very special and we would change it for the world. There are some major differences. The traffic is faster. The landscape is hillier. The sun is hotter. Their are more stores, more cars, and more red tape. It's like we've taken off the training wheels and here is "real" life slapping us in the face.</div>
