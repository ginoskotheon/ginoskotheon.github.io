          p I have spent the last 15 years in music education and now I'm working toward a career in web development. I am proficient in all HTML, CSS, and javascript. I know Python Django and also the MEAN stack. I can use both Reactjs and Angular2.

            p 11 years of my life were lived in China. 2 years were in Beijing and 9 years were spent in the beautiful coastal city of Qingdao. That experience has instilled a global perspective and given me a second language. 不用问，我当然会讲汉语.

          p Beyond this, I have skills in 3D art and have done several freelance jobs in this arena including logo design and vehicle modeling.
